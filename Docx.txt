Introduction:

Welcome to the documentation for your trading application! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the app's features, usage, and considerations for optimal performance.

Invalid Symbol Issue Reasons:

If you encounter an "Invalid Symbol" issue while fetching trade data, it might be due to the following reasons:

Symbol Existence:

Ensure that the symbol you are trying to fetch exists and is valid for trading in your current context.
Earn vs. Spot Wallet:

If your assets are in the Earn wallet, use the appropriate method for fetching trades, as the get_my_trades function typically works for the Spot wallet.

App Features:

Account Information:
	Display essential account information, including token balances (free and locked) for the admin.

	Provide a list of registered clients with IDs, usernames, and status (active or inactive).
	Include buttons for viewing, editing, deactivating, and removing each client.

To Do:-

Error Handling:

	Additional Features to Add:

Data Filtering:
	Enable the admin to filter trades based on criteria such as date range, specific symbols, or profit/loss thresholds.

More Analytics:
	Incorporate more sophisticated analytics, including performance metrics, trade frequency, or risk analysis.
	
Notifications:

	Implement a notification system to alert the admin about important events, such as significant profit/loss, high trade frequency, or inactive 	clients.

Important Note:
	Please be cautious when using the create_test_order method, as it's intended for testing purposes. For actual orders, use the create_order 	method, understanding the implications and risks involved in placing real orders.
